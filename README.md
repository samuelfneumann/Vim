## Plugins

All plugins use the built-in Vim plugin manager. They do not use Vundle, or
Vim-plug or any other complicated plugin manager. Rather, everything must be
done manually by hand using `git` and Vim's builtin plugin system. 

### Julia-Vim

[Julia-Vim](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim/tree/master/keymap)
is used to get `LaTeÎ§` symbols as-you-type. The plugin options are defined in 
`vimrc` under the relevant folding. To install this plugin:

```bash
cd ~/.vim
mkdir -p pack/plugins/start && cd pack/plugins/start
git clone git://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim.git
```
### JuliaFormatter
[JuliaFormatter](https://github.com/kdheepak/JuliaFormatter.vim) is used to
format `Julia` code, since the
[Julia-Vim](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim/tree/master/keymap)
plugin formats it in a very strange way. The JuliaFormatter plugin has a lot of
functionality for formatting `Julia` code according to different style guides.
The formatting of this plugin is remapped to `gg=G` to format the entire
file and `=` to format a selection, and `==` to format a line, as is the usual
case in vim.

To install this plugin:
```bash
cd ~/.vim
mkdir -p pack/plugins/start && cd pack/plugins/start
git clone git@github.com:kdheepak/JuliaFormatter.vim.git
```
